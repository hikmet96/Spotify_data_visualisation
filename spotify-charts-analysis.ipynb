Each year, new platforms and mediums skyrocket to stand out, make a name for themselves, and reshape the way audiences connect with artists. At the same time, new technologies put creative tools in the hands of people who were previously unable to access them. Obviously, this industry is growing rapidly and becoming more competitive. Companies are having to differentiate themselves by providing unique, artist-focused content or developing different pricing models. Spotify, founded in 2006, has become the most popular streaming platform worldwide. We will use the data set from this platform to analyze song trends of singers. From there, it is possible to suggest solutions to improve the popularity of singers, which in turn will help them be more competitive and successful in the music industry."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Import
